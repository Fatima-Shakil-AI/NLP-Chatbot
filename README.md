AI Conversational Chatbot
Overview

This project demonstrates a conversational AI chatbot built using Transformer-based language models from the Hugging Face transformers library.
The chatbot is designed to engage in natural, context-aware conversations with users — answering questions, explaining AI topics, and generating creative text replies.
The model uses Mistral-7B-Instruct — a modern instruction-tuned model that produces intelligent, relevant, and conversational responses. It showcases skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning, and language model deployment.

Key Features

✅ Conversational AI built using Transformer architecture
✅ Runs locally in Google Colab using Hugging Face pipeline
✅ Generates intelligent, coherent responses in real time
✅ Demonstrates NLP pipeline setup, prompt engineering, and text generation
✅ Optional integration with Gradio for an interactive web interface
